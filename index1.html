    <p>Agriculture is a <mark>big part of the economy</mark> of any country because it helps feed the entire population. It <b>connects and communicates </b>with all of the related industries. If the agriculture base is strong, it is generally regarded as a<strong>socially and politically</strong>  stable society. Many modern farms make use of <mark>cutting-edge technology </mark>and scientific and technological ideas. The following are some of the reasons for food supply chain problems and processing environment challenges. The maximization of the profits relies on some farmersâ€™ vegetables and fruits with chemicals.<em>Chemical fertilizers, insecticides,</em>  and other compounds are used in several plants and fruits. As a result, pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits become excessive. It is a significant health risk. Food gets contaminated with heavy metals. <The irrigation water source of crops is polluted by the excessive intrusion of heavy metal elements such as lead, tin, mercury, and zinc, which are dangerous to human health. Food additives are used excessively in food processing. </p>
